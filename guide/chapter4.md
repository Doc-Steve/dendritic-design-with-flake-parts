# Acknowledgement and additional information

Thanks to everyone who inspired me in creating my own Dendritic setup and finally this guide. Their valuable information, tools, and reference repositories were very helpful in this endeavor. A special thank you goes to [Victor Borja (@vic)](https://github.com/vic) for his invaluable support and insightful input in creating this guide!

You’ll find references to my favorite resources below.

If you're developing a specific feature and seeking inspiration, GitHub can be a valuable resource.
Simply search for

```
lang:nix flake.modules SOME-OPTION
```

and you'll often find implementations that can be used for a Dendritic setup.
